    Calculate/generate the response surface model
    The input can be either an R object or a .csv file. Excel is currently not supported, but it might be in the future (imported directly by R)
    data is the csv or R dataframe with the complete design plus the Results
    inputfile is the same as in the box_behnken function: it is the csv or excel with the initial values, before the design was made.
    Use write_summary = "filename.txt" to write the summary to a specific file. Alternativly just write_summary = True will output it with a standard name.
