FUNCTIONS:

-HPLC SOLVENT CALCULATOR
Will calculate how much of a given eluent is used in a run. Flow and time must be in the SAME UNIT! Result will be in the same volume unit as flow.
You can use hplc_solvent_manual, where you have to create numpy arrays yourself, such as:
    y = np.array([90, 0])
    x = np.array([0, 20])
and then feed them to the function. Althernatively, you can just use the simpler hplc_solvent, which takes in a correctly formatted dataframe.
